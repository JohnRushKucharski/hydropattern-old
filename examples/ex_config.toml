# This is an example configuration file.
# More information about toml files here: https://toml.io/en/

# These files configure the hydropattern application.
# The application tracks the occurence of components of
# natural flow regimes in hydrologic timeseries.

# This example file contains configuration data needed to:
# 1 - identify hydrologic timeseries that will be evaluated, and
# 2 - define a natural flow regime components.

# The program uses the functional flows terminology.

# Note: Figure 2 and Table 2 are particularly helpful.

# Basic terminology:
# COMPONENT: Natural flow regimes are composed of one or 
#   more components.
# CHARACTERISTIC: components are composed of one or more
#   of the following characteristics:
#   Magnitude, Timing, Duration, Frequency, Rate of Change.
# METRICS: describe the the truth value for each characteristic
#   (when evaluated in a hydrologic timeseries).
# VERBOSE: true if characteristic should be evaluated when
#   other component characteristics requirements are not met.
#   true by default.
# SUCCESS PATTERN: describes if each characteristic being
#   true represents a success or failure.
#   true by default.

# -------------------DEFINE COMPONENTS------------------- #
# first component.
[components.november_pulse_flow]           # name of the component.

# component compute options:
# verbose = true                # evaluate characteristics (in order) if component can be met, defaults to true.
# success_pattern = true        # component is present if all characteristics are met, defaults to true.
# note: verbose option must be set before characteristics.

# characteristics:

# -------------Timeseries Parameter Notes---------------- #
# Path: must be path to *.csv file, with following header row:
#   time, <column_name_1>, ..., <column_name_n>
# Time_format: string datetime formate code
#   ex: use "%Y-%m-%d" for date in format "1900-01-31" (i.e., 31 Jan 1900).
#   see: https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior 
# First_day_of_water_year: day of year associated with start of water year.  
#   - defaults to 1 (i.e., 01 Jan).
#   - based on 365 day year (i.e. 59 = 28 Feb, 60 = 01 Mar)
#   - must be positive integer on range [1, 365].
#   - note during leap years (i.e. day of year, day of water year is same for 28 and 29 Feb)
# Columns: file columns containing hydrologic data
#   - must be positive integer, since column 0 must be 'time' column.
# ------------------------------------------------------- #

# -------------Characteristic Metric Notes--------------- #
# Timing: in form [first_doy, last_doy] 
#   - day of year (doy) NOT day of water year values.
#   - both doy values are inclusive.
#   - must be positive integers on range [1, 366].
# Magnitude: in form [operator, value, (optional)ma_periods]
#   - operators: >, <, =
#   - value: same units as timeseries.
#   - value: must be positive real number.
#   - ma_periods: creates moving average for time series s.t:
#           y_t = | 0 if t < k - 1 
#                 | (x_[t-k+1]+x[t-k+2]+...+x_t)/k o/w
#       where x is a time series of hyrologic values, and
#       ma_periods=k. Defaults to k=1.
#   - value is compared against y_t (defined above).
# Rate of Change: in form ...
#   [operator, value, (optional)ma_periods, (optional)look_back, (optional)min]
#   - operators: >, <, =
#   - ma_periods: same as for magnitude characteristic above.
#   - look_back: positive integer used in equation:
#           z_t = y_t / y_[t-n]
#       where y is time series of hydrologic values or
#       moving average from time series of hydrologic values, and
#       look_back=n. Defaults to n=1.
#   - value: is compared against z_t (defined above).
#   - min: minimum value for lookback value: y[t-n].
#       Must be a positive real value.
#       Defaults to 0, see lookback and value note.
#   - look_back and value: if y_[t-n] is 0 and min is 0
#        an exception is NOT raised and any positive value will succeed.    
# Duration: in form [operator, time_steps]
#   - operators: >, <, =
#   - time_steps: number of previous timesteps over which 
#       other component characteristics must be true.
#   - time_steps: must be positive integer.
# Frequency: [operator, value] OR [operator, n_times, N_years]
#   - operators: >, <, =
#   - value: annual frequency as postive real number on range [0, 1].
#   - n_times: number of time condition must occur in N_years.
#   - N_years: continous period of years over which condition
#       is evaluated.
#   - n_times and N_years: must be postive integers.
